# Summary

This item is a low poly face mask perfect for masquerades or Halloween. It has an open mouth and holes for the nose so you can breathe ease, although you might sweat. There are slits on the sides for an elastic head strap. It's sized to fit 150mm x 150mm (6x6) print beds.

This mask was recently used on The Flash TV series! Thanks to xcasex for noticing it and StormtrooperAimm for taking a screenshot.

Backstory on Version 2
---------------------------------

After remixing minimalex's "Low Poly Mask Thinned" model so it would fit on my printrbot. It ended up being too small on some parts on my face. The original mask has sullen cheeks and narrow temples, which made the fit tight and very uncomfortable. Also, the breathing holes weren't big enough and still felt constricting wearing it. So I completely rebuilt the mask from scratch, using the original as a template.

This new version is wider on the jaw and cheeks. The thickness of the entire model is now 2mm. Previous version was not even on some spots, so a bit of filament savings. The eyes are no longer squinting which helps with visibility and the eyelashes sweeping on the edges. The mouth is now open with a slight grin and you can breath easy or stick your tongue out. :}~

Lastly, I added a buckle for the head strap. The strap should be about 1/2 inch in width.

I'll keep my remixed version on here, but I recommend Version 2 since it's a complete remodel and will most likely fit better. And it still fits on a 6" x 6" bed. 



# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .2mm
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
I recommend printing the mask in PLA in case it feels a bit tight. PLA can be heat molded to fit better.

No need for supports. I printed my mask with natural PETG using honeycomb infill. Looks pretty neat. Took about 7 and half hours to print.


# Post-Printing

Most likely you'll need to cut off some hanging strands due to the over hangs on the eyes and mouth if you use a harder filament. Should print out pretty cleanly.
