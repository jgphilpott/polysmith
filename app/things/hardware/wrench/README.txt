# Summary

After watching the infamous video from a few years back where Z-Corp prints a fully working wrench i decided i wanted to do the same thing on my own printer.  

Now, i am not talking about a "print-several-pieces-and-then-assemble" version which there are already a ton of on the internet.   
What i wanted to do was something i could print and that would actually be fully working straight out of the printer.   
I like to think i came pretty close. All you need to do is to remove the internal support and your done!  

Keep in mind this is a proof of concept, i just wanted to see if i could do it.  

Updated 2013-10-16: Added "Printable Wrench W Longer Screw" which has a longer "screw" (3mm).  

Updated 2013-08-30: I have added two new files. One with a slightly bigger gap between moving parts. This one has 0,55mm gap instead of 0,35mm. Let me know if it works out (in particular with PLA). I have also added a STEP file with no support for anyone who maight want it.
