# Golf Tee Block

## Intro

The Golf Tee Block is available with or without a name/logo. If you would like to have a custom name/logo you can try to make it yourself by modifying the blank model or email me (jacob.philpott@gmx.com) and I can make it for you, for a price of course.

The model is also available with four or five ground spikes.
