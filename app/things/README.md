# Things

This directory contains collections of 3D models (mostly in [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) or [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) format) that can be used for 3D printing. In general higher level directories represent categories and the lowest level directory represents a thing. Thing directories contain a 3D model or set of models, possibly images, a README and other relevant pieces of data as well. If the thing was designed with Polymorph it should also contain a polygen function that can be used to create/view the thing. Polygen functions can be in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [CoffeeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript) or [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) and should be copied into the corresponding root file in the [scripts directory](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polymorph/tree/master/app/scripts). You can also view and download these things on several different websites listed here:
